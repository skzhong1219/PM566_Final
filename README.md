**Do Suicide Rates Differ Between Men and Women Around the World?**

This project focuses on the gender paradox in suicide rates. The gender paradox is the disparity in suicide rates between men and women where men have higher rates of suicide. Through my research, it was apparent that the gender paradox is an ongoing problem in the U.S. However, I also wanted to see whether the same trend can be seen in other parts of the world. I used suicide rate data from the World Health Organization as well as population data from the United Nations' Populations Division. Through this project, I was able to see that male suicide rates are higher than female suicide rates in different regions of the world.
